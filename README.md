# restaurant-page
A restaurant page inspired by pizza tower
Images are credited to pizza tower, except for the one fanart in contacts which I couldn't find.

Post commentary: Webpack sure is... interesting. Guess I took the ease of importing modules in Python for granted, as I found the gymnastics to get that functionality to be a real pain here.
